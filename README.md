# Requirements-affected Activities and their Attributes

This repository contains the data, material, source code, and results of the initiative of creating and maintaining a harmonized model of requirements-affected activities and their attributes. 

Requirements fulfill a purpose of informing subsequent software engineering activities that are affected by them, i.e., that use these requirements as an input. The figure below visualizes a simplified software development process and highlights activities that count as *requirements-affected* since they use a requirements specification as an input.
