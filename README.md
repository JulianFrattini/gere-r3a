# Requirements-affected Activities and their Attributes

This repository contains the data, material, source code, and results of the initiative of creating and maintaining a harmonized model of requirements-affected activities and their attributes. 

Requirements fulfill a purpose of informing subsequent software engineering activities that are affected by them, i.e., that use these requirements as an input. The figure below visualizes a simplified software development process and highlights activities that count as *requirements-affected* since they use a requirements specification as an input.

Given a lack of a systematic overview of requirements-affected activities and their attributes, by which they can be measured, we initiate the construction of such a model in our initial study. The first version of the model looks as follows.

  * figures: additional figures for visualization of results
  * util: utility source code files
* requirements.txt: list of required Python libraries to execute the source code files

### Table Details

The following contains more information about certain, more complex tables.

## System Requirements

The following requirements must be met in order to utilize the artifacts contained in this repository:

* To utilize **the data**, you need a spreadsheet software like [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/microsoft-365/excel) to open the .xlsx file.
* To exectute **the code**, [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) must be available and an editor software like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended.
* To edit **the figures**, you require an editor capable of opening Graph Markup Language (`.graphml`) files, for example the [yEd Graph Editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed).

However, all figures are also provided in vector graphic (`.pdf`) and pixel graphic (`.png`) format for an easier viewing experience independent of a graph editor.

## Installation Instructions

To execute the code contained in this repository, make sure all requirements contained in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) are installed by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To avoid conflicts with the local Python environment, create a separate [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

1. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment with `./venv/Scripts/activate`
3. Install the requirements as described above.
4. Install the ipykernel either by selecting the virtual environment `.venv` as the runtime environment for the Jupyter notebook in VS Code (which will trigger VS Code to automatically install the ipykernel) or [install it manually](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel).

Once the virtual environment is running and all requirements installed and ipykernel are installed, the Jupyter notebook can be executed from the virtual environment.

## Steps to Replicate

The following subsections highlight how to use the artifacts in this repository in order to comprehend the steps of the study.

### Systematic Literature Review on Requirements Experimentation

In order to understand the SLR on human-subject experimentation involving requirements specifications, conduct the following steps:

1. Review the [SLR guidelines](./1-data-collection/experimentation-literature/review-guideline.pdf), which describe the overall approach of this review.
2. Inspect the [list of venues](./1-data-collection/experimentation-literature/r3a-venues.xlsx). The sheets "Conferences" and "Journals" contain all Software Engineering (SE) venues with a [CORE rank](portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks) of A* or A (plus a few select additions relevant to requirements engineering). Both sheets contain a classification of whether they are actually relevant to SE or not.
3. Inspect the [selection of venues](./1-data-collection/experimentation-literature/r3a-venues.xlsx), i.e., the sheet named "Selection", for a summary of all SE relevant venues plus their search term for the respective library where the venue is reliably indexed.
4. Review the articles returned by the database searches. Each file in the [candidates directory](./1-data-collection/experimentation-literature/primary-study-candidates/) contains the search results for one respective venue (identifiable by the acronym contained in the file title).
5. Inspect the [inclusion table](./1-data-collection/experimentation-literature/r3a-slr-experimentation.xlsx):
    1. The sheet "Candidates" assembles the search results of all files from the candidates directory. It further contains the rating of the inclusion and exclusion criteria (I1, I2, E1-E4).
    2. The sheet "Venues" shows an overview over all venues. The column "IP" calculates the inclusion percentage, i.e., how many of the candidates from the database search of this venue (total number in column "N") were included.
    3. The sheets "Overlap" and "Overlap 2" show the independent execution of the inclusion criteria to a random sample of studies. 
    4. The sheets "Agreement" and "Agreement 2" contrast the decision of the two raters and show disagreements.
6. Execute the [validity notebook](./1-data-collection/experimentation-literature/validity_inclusion.ipynb) to recalculate the interrater agreement between two raters (Overlap 2).
